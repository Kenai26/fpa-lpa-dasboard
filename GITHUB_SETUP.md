## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Walmart GitHub
1. Open your browser
2. Go to one of these URLs (depending on your access):
   - **https://github.wmt.com** (most common)
   - **https://github.walmart.com** (alternative)
   - **Or your internal GitHub instance**
3. Log in with your **Walmart credentials**

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

**Look for one of these:**
- A **"+"** button (usually top right)
- A **"New"** button (usually top left)
- A **"Create repository"** option

**Click it and select "New repository"**

### Step 3: Configure Repository Settings

On the "Create a new repository" page, fill in:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Repository name** | `fpa-lpa-dashboard` |
| **Description** | `FPA/LPA Performance Dashboard for DC 6084` (optional) |
| **Visibility** | **Private** (important - internal only) |
| **Initialize this repository with** | ❌ Leave UNCHECKED (we have code already) |
| **Add .gitignore** | Leave empty |
| **Add a license** | Leave empty |

### Step 4: Create the Repository

1. Click **"Create repository"** (blue button)
2. Wait a few seconds for GitHub to create the repo
3. You'll see a page with setup instructions ("Quick setup")

### Step 5: Get Your Repository URL

1. On the setup page, look for a **green "Code" button** (or "Clone" button)
2. Click it
3. Select **"HTTPS"** (should be default)
4. **Copy the URL**

It will look like one of these:
```
https://github.wmt.com/your-username/fpa-lpa-dashboard.git
