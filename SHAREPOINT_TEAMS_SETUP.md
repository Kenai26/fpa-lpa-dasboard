## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see a Files tab"
1. Make sure you're in a **Team** (not a chat)
2. Look for **"Files"** at the top of the team
3. If still missing, click **"..."** (more options) → **"Files"**

### "Upload button is greyed out"
1. You might not have permission
2. Ask your **Team Owner** to give you upload access
3. Or upload to a Public channel

### "The link doesn't work"
1. Make sure file is **shareable** (right-click → Share)
2. Check permission level (should be viewable by team/org)
3. Try opening in **Incognito** window
4. Refresh the page

### "Files uploaded but dashboard doesn't load"
1. Verify all 5 files are uploaded together:
   - index.html
   - app.js
   - styles.css
   - data.js
   - import.js
2. Make sure you're opening **index.html** (not app.js)
3. Clear browser cache and refresh

### "I need to update the dashboard"
1. Download the updated files from your project
2. Upload them again to SharePoint (they'll overwrite)
3. Refresh the browser link
4. Done! 🎉
